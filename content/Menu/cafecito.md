Coffee with 2 spoons of sugar

My grandmaâ€™s favorite red plastic cup with bread from her hometown

My family loves pan dulce or any type of bread. It is kinda ridiculous how we can not live without this. This all stems from my grandma also being obsessed with bread, although the doctor told her to limit herself from sweets she could never stop eating bread. That was the one thing she simply could not give up. Every day at 8:30 p.m my uncle boils water and they get ready to sip some coffee and eat some sweet bread.
