These tacos were the go-to. Imagine getting out of class, it’s hot and you have a cold glass cola-coke bottle you know some tacos are going to perfectly hit the spot.  These were always the ones that would sell out the quickest. IT WAS A MUST! To always get them with green salsa.  My grandma, mom, and aunt would carry baskets and pots just filled with these. No matter how much they took they always sold out and people wanted more!
