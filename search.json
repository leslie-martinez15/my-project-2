My mom talks about the fun times she had while growing up in Acapulco, climbing mango trees and running away from cows. It’s too funny to ever imagine my mom acting that way. One thing that she brings up often is the clutter of dishes my grandmother has in her kitchen; the horror stories of how she would come back from school just to be forced to wash piles of dishes.\nEveryone knew my grandmother made the best tacos and tortas in town. My grandmother, along with my uncle, would roll out their wheelbarrow filled to the brim with plates and cups. At the same time, my other two uncles would carry the agua frescas of watermelon and Jamaica. My mom and aunt would carry baskets and pots filled with tacos. At the same time, my grandma took a basket on her head filled with even more food. All this preparation was just for lunchtime when students would come out and buy. My grandma was cool; even when students couldn’t afford lunch that day, she couldn’t bear to let a child go hungry. She would always let them slide and say you can pay me next time.\nWhen I was lucky enough to travel to Acapulco, her kitchen allowed me to see a side of her that I couldn’t grow up with. The person that was there in front of the school and always happy to see you eat well. Her pink kitchen walls filled with hanging pots and pans, damaged from all the years she used them for cooking. Even though they were all shabby, filled with grease and burn marks, she didn’t let anyone throw them away. It was her way of showing her love of cooking and the passion she had for making food for people. How much I regret being a picky eater when I was a kid, I would have loved to be able to try my grandmother’s cooking.\nEven when she couldn’t cook anymore, she would not let anyone touch her dishes. They could have been to the point of unusable but insisted my mom and uncle never throw them away. Her bedroom is now filled with dishes that have been stored away throughout the years.\nI see these dishes as my grandmother’s hard work that was able to provide a home for not only my mom and her siblings but generations to come.\n","id":2,"length":416,"title":"Introduction by Leslie: La Cocina de mi Abuela","type":"splash","url":"/intro/"},{"content":"I was 6 years old when my mom started selling food and during this time she barely had any dishes to work with. Meaning that most of the time, she had a limited amount of things to sell. This didn’t stop her and she continued working and becoming more successful; she began to buy dishes to help with her sales. The more dishes she bought the more she was able to sell, and cook newer things. When she couldn’t afford to buy supplies, she used credit to buy even more. She was shy about asking for any help as she was trying to help my father with income. It was here when she made it her goal that she will do things on her own.\nHer kitchen quickly filled up and it got to the point where once you entered the kitchen there would be dishes at any corner you looked at. The walls were covered by hanging pots and pans, with the sink covered by a mountain of dishes.\nMy siblings and I helped in any way we could. Especially having to wash all of the dishes. We would also help in preparing the food for the upcoming day. My brothers would go out and cut wood for the fire, while my sister and I would fry the tacos. My mother would cook the mole sauce, the chicken that was going to be used, and many more. It was in the kitchen, where we could connect with my mother the most. This was where I saw my mother the happiest.\nEven before my mother was at school, neighbors would just show up at the house asking if they can buy food already bringing their own plates. Of course, my mom had everything done since we have been working on the food since 4 in the morning. Everyone would always come up to us with boogers running down their nose, “This salsa is amazing!” As they dunked even more green salsa onto their tacos. Once my mom had her table set up in front of the school, parents would drop off their kids and head straight to my mother’s stand.\nMy mother\u0026rsquo;s stand was a wooden table that my father would frequently fix when it started to become worn out. It was something simple, but it helped her sell for the next 46 years. Even when I moved to the United States at the age of 20, my mother continued selling her food. My sister continued to help her and was the one who also started to take care of our mom. The years of working so intensely had begun to affect my mother.\nShe had become tired and her knees started to affect her ability to walk. For the first time, she gave up some of her dishes, she sold them to be able to afford her medication. After my mom stopped selling her food, my brothers put all her remaining dishes in containers and placed them all in her bedroom. Even though they were in storage containers, my mother told us to never touch them. My mother kept getting worse to the point where she became immobile.\nShe passed away on June 15, 2022. It still feels so horrible having to say that. However, I know how much of an influence she was on our town. I remember during the ceremony the priest mentioned how she was able to feed the whole town. How she was able to help out other food vendors start up their own businesses. People would come up to me saying how much they had missed my mother’s cooking.\nAlthough my brother and I may not know what to do with her dishes currently. I know how much they meant to her and the importance that they carry.\n","id":3,"length":634,"title":"Life starts in the Kitchen - Writing by Imelda Martinez","type":"splash","url":"/essay/"},{"content":"","id":4,"length":"","title":"FOOD","type":"","url":""},{"content":" 3 tacos per plate\nPotatoes wrapped with homemade tortillas with queso fresco, lettuce, and optional green salsa\n These tacos were the go-to.
