I didn’t have the chance to grow up with my family; they all live in Mexico. My mom talks about the fun times she had while growing up in Acapulco, climbing mango trees and running away from cows. It’s too funny to ever imagine my mom acting that way. One thing that she brings up often is the clutter of dishes my grandmother has in her kitchen; the horror stories of how she would come back from school just to be forced to wash piles of dishes. [RL1]

Everyone knew my grandmother made the best tacos and tortas in town. My grandmother, along with my uncle, would roll out their wheelbarrow filled to the brim with plates and cups. At the same time, my other two uncles would carry the agua frescas of watermelon and Jamaica. My mom and aunt would carry baskets and pots filled with tacos. At the same time, my grandma took a basket on her head filled with even more food. All this preparation was just for lunchtime when students would come out and buy. My grandma was cool; even when students couldn’t afford lunch that day, she couldn’t bear to let a child go hungry. She would always let them slide and say you can pay me next time.

When I was lucky enough to travel to Acapulco, her kitchen allowed me to see a side of her that I couldn’t grow up with. The person that was there in front of the school and always happy to see you eat well. Her pink kitchen walls filled with hanging pots and pans, damaged from all the years she used them for cooking. Even though they were all shabby, filled with grease and burn marks, she didn’t let anyone throw them away. It was her way of showing her love of cooking and the passion she had for making food for people. How much I regret being a picky eater when I was a kid, I would have loved to be able to try my grandmother’s cooking.

Even when she couldn’t cook anymore, she would not let anyone touch her dishes. They could have been to the point of unusable but insisted my mom and uncle never throw them away. Her bedroom is now filled with dishes that have been stored away throughout the years.

I see these dishes as my grandmother’s hard work that was able to provide a home for not only my mom and her siblings but generations to come.
